                        Welcome!   1. This page provides information you may want before deciding whether to complete this survey.  The same questionnaire is being used nationwide to learn from research participants' feedback (Empowering the Participant Voice*).    a. The survey that follows is part of a research study conducted by [INSERT PI] at [INSERT INSTITUTION].  The purpose of the research is to understand research participants' experiences and enhance them.       b. The survey that follows is part of our quality assurance program conducted by [INSTITUTION] University.  2. Participation involves completing the survey.  The survey asks about you and your most recent research experience.  It will take 5-7 minutes to complete the survey. For your answers to be saved, you must click "Done" at the end of the survey. Plan to complete the survey in one sitting.  3. There are no direct benefits to you. However, the survey results may help us understand how to improve the research participation experience at this research center and others across the country.   4. We will do our best to protect your information, but there is always a small risk of loss of confidentiality.  To further minimize the risks to confidentiality, we do NOT ask for any details about your prior research studies, doctors, hospitals, or any diagnoses.  5. Survey responses are analyzed as a group to identify areas of excellence and opportunities for improvement. We will NOT reveal any individual survey responses to staff or research teams nor in our publications.   6. There is no compensation for completing the survey.  7. Your participation is voluntary and you can change your mind. Your answers will not be recorded until you click "Done" at the end of the survey.

                            Please answer the questions below regarding the research study you enrolled in within the past year. If you enrolled in more than one study, answer for the most recent study.

When the survey questions refer to "the study," we are asking about your experiences enrolled in that clinical research study, not this online survey study.
